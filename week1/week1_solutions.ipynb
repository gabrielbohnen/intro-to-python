    "Your challenge is to implement a basic phone book using a dictionary in Python. This phone book will use a dictionary named `phone_book` to store and manage contacts, with each contact's name as the key and their phone number as the value. You will need to complete the implementation of several functions to handle common phone book operations, adhering to the specifications provided in their respective docstrings.\n",

    "2. **Remove Contact**: Implement a function to remove an existing contact from the phone book.\n",

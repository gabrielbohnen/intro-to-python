In most instances whilst working at EQL, you will not need to use the bash commands to track changes in a repository. Rather, you will use VS Code's Source Control Graphical User Interface (GUI), or the Git GUI software. Rather than typing out a couple of lines of code in a terminal you can press a couple of pretty buttons!\n",
